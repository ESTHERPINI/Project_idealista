Data research
-------
* The first Real State website in Spain is *Idealista*. I contacted them to get autoritation to get information from **[API](https://developers.idealista.com/access-request)** (*API_KEY,SECRET_KEY*).
* [munimadrid](https://www.madrid.es/portal/site/munimadrid) website contains many resources to implement the future **ML MODEL**:
  * Something important could be is there is school centers in the area.
  * Criminality ratio.
* From wikipedia we'll get population by district in order to get the different ratios/population.
